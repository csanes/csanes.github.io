Time to take a break and reflect on the progress. I found out about GitHub Pages and decided to create a web portfolio site on the platform. Naturally I had no idea how to use Git, GitHub, Git Bash, or Jekyll. What's that phrase about biting off more than you can chew?

There's a great book online that got this effort jumpstarted: [Pro Git][pro-git-book]. This free book has everything you need to setup Git in whatever working evironment you can think of. Chapters include Git basics, branching, distributed workflows, GitHub, and much more. 

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

``` git
$ git init
```

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository][jekyll-help].
