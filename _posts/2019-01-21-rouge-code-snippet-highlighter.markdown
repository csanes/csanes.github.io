This is a test of the Rouge code snippet highlighter with PHP, Javascript, and HTML:

#### PHP
``` php
<?php echo "Hello World!";?>
```

#### Javascript
``` javascript
<button type="button" onclick='document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!"'>Click Me!</button>
```

#### HTML
``` html
<ul class="list-style-none mb-0  border-top pt-3">
```

Seems to work. There's a list of supported languages and lexers at the [Github repo][github-repo-rouge] for Rouge.
