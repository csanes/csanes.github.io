Sometimes you have to take the long way to your goal. This project so far has forced me to spend excess time learning and researching answers to problems related to Git, Github, Jekyll, and my new friend [Markdown][markdown-spec].

This is my second or third encounter with a language that is intended to output another language in the interest of promoting less code and more readability. It didn't take long to figure out the syntax from the linked spec. Building in a new language from the ground up is difficult so I copy and pasted examples of Markdown in use, then changed what I wanted to use.
